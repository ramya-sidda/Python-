Number Guessing program
The program generates a random number and keeps asking the user to guess until the correct number is entered.
In this we are using import random module to get the random variable 
 
import random
number = random.randint(1, 10)
guess = 0
while guess != number:
    guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))
    if guess < number:
        print("Too low!")
    elif guess > number:
        print("Too high!")
    else:
        print("Correct! You guessed the number.")
